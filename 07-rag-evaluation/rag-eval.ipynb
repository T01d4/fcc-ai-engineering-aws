On-field umpires could penalise the bowling team by not allowing more than four fielders outside the 30-yard circle. Pakistan\\'s participation The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had threatened to boycott the tournament after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) refused to send a team to the 2023 Asia Cup scheduled in Pakistan. This issue was resolved in June 2023 after the Asian Cricket Council announced that the tournament would be hosted using a hybrid model proposed by the PCB, with nine of the 13 matches in the competition played in Sri Lanka.See also List of Cricket World Cup finals References ^ \"2023 ODI World Cup shatters viewership records\".

It was hosted from 5 October to 19 November 2023 across ten venues in India. This was the fourth World Cup held in India, but the first where India was the sole host. The tournament was contested by ten national teams, maintaining the same format used in 2019. After six weeks of round-robin matches, India, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand finished as the top four and qualified for the knockout stage. In the knockout stage, India and Australia beat New Zealand and South Africa, respectively, to advance to the final, played on 19 November at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Australia won the final by six wickets, winning their sixth Cricket World Cup title. A total of 1,250,307 spectators attended the matches, the highest number in any Cricket World Cup to date. The tournament final set viewership records in India, drawing 518 million viewers, with a peak of 57 million streaming viewers.Marketing The ICC hosted a trophy tour for 100 days prior to the tournament beginning 27 June, with the Cricket World Cup Trophy being taken to various locations around the world. The event began with the launching of the trophy into the stratosphere by Sent Into Space and landing at Modi Stadium—becoming the first sports trophy to have ever been sent into space. The ICC officially announced the mascots for the World Cup in August. The mascots were a male and female duo named \"Tonk\" and \"Blaze\" from the fictional cricketing utopia \"Crictoverse\". Ahead of the tournament, it was reported that an opening ceremony would take place on 4 October 2023 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, a day before the opening match at the same venue. The official theme song of the 2023 Cricket World Cup titled \"Dil Jashn Bole\" (transl. Heart say celebrate) was released on 20 September. The song was composed by Pritam, and was sung by Pritam, Nakash Aziz, Sreerama Chandra, Amit Mishra, Jonita Gandhi, Akasa Singh and S. P. Charan. However, the song was subject to backlash and bad reviews. The opening ceremony was cancelled and replaced by a closing ceremony ahead of the final. During this a drone show was held.']\n",
